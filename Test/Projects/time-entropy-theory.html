    <h1>Time-Entropy Interaction Theory (TEIT)</h1>

    <p><strong>Time</strong> is not merely a passive, linear backdrop to physical events. In TEIT, time is understood as a directional gradient through which entropy flows into matter, causing interaction, energy transformation, and space-time warping. This theory reframes time as the active agent of change in the universe, not just a coordinate.</p>

    <h2>Core Concept</h2>
    <p>When a mass exists in a universe without time, no change occurs. It cannot bend space, cause gravity, or radiate. But the moment this mass is placed within the directional “river” of time, entropy begins. This influx of entropy interacts with the mass, producing what we experience as energy output, gravitational pull, and observable motion.</p>

    <h2>Time as Entropy Flux</h2>
    <p>Entropy is not simply a measurement of disorder but the very essence of time’s action on matter. At absolute zero (0 K), with no entropy flowing, quantum systems become easier to isolate, suggesting time and entropy are deeply entangled. In this view, <strong>quantum behavior reflects the state of matter without the active influence of entropy</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Reframing Gravity</h2>
    <p>If a star like the sun were to burn out but retain its mass, would gravity persist the same? According to TEIT, maybe not exactly — because its entropy output would drop. Gravitational interaction could depend not only on mass but also on its active participation in time via entropy emissions. This could explain why energetic systems like stars and quasars warp spacetime so intensely.</p>

    <h2>Experimental Direction</h2>
    <p>We hypothesize that entropy gradients could be directly measured via high-sensitivity instruments in low-gravity space. For instance, containing a laser in space and surrounding it with gravitational sensors might show minute space-time warps caused by high photon energy densities. This could be a precursor to experimentally testing TEIT concepts.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Time is not a neutral canvas — it is a gradient that enables entropy to interact with matter, causing all the familiar physical phenomena we observe: from light, to gravity, to quantum behavior. TEIT reorients our understanding of time from passive dimension to active agent, offering a new perspective on long-standing physical
